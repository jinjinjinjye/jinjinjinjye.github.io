I am a cognitive scientist working at the [NUS Language and Computation Lab](https://langcomplab.github.io/). My current project is managing the [Small World of Singlish Words](https://singlishwords.nus.edu.sg/) project which aims to collect word association data for Singlish words. My current area of study is the analysis of the structure of the mental lexicon: the network of concepts within our minds.

In addition to cognitive science and psycholinguistics, I am interested in computational linguistics, natural language processing, and large language models. I am aiming to brush up on my data science skills.
