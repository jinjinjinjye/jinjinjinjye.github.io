I am currently a Master's student in the NUS Department of Physics under their first ever [AI for Science](https://www.physics.nus.edu.sg/student/msc-ai-for-science-curriculum/) programme, where I hope to brush up on my data science and NLP skills. 

Employment-wise, I am looking for an internship in any data-related role, and am open to doing fundamental work such as data cleaning and maintenance. 

Previously, I was at the [NUS Language and Computation Lab](https://langcomplab.github.io/) where I was in charge of managing the [Small World of Singlish Words](https://singlishwords.nus.edu.sg/) project, which aims to collect word association data for Singlish words. My area of study under psychology was the analysis of the structure of the mental lexicon: the network of concepts within our minds.

My areas of interest, apart from psycholinguistics, are computational linguistics, natural language processing, and large language models.
