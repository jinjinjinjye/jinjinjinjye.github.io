I am a cognitive scientist working at the [NUS Language and Computation Lab](https://langcomplab.github.io/). My current project is managing the [Small World of Singlish Words](https://singlishwords.nus.edu.sg/) project which aims to collect word association date for Singlish Words. 

In addition to cognitive science, I am interested in computational linguistics, AI in general, and Large Language Models. I am aiming to brush up on my data science skills.
